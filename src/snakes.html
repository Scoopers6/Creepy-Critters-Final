        <p>
          Snakes might be scary or spooky, but they’re actually very helpful! Without snakes, rats, mice, and other rodents would run wild and spread disease without any barriers. It is important to keep in mind that no animal is really a pest and everyone is just doing their part in a larger ecosystem! Snakes are widespread throughout the world and some of them even live in water. Many species are dangerous but many of them are not. If you encounter a snake, attempt to identify them before you interact! Snakes will bite even if they aren’t venomous as a defense mechanism. A good rule of thumb is to simply leave these guys where they are! If you find one inside your house, please call a professional or act with extreme caution.

        This is a juvenile milk snake found Upstate NY. This little guy was wandering in an area of the yard with heavy foot traffic, so our story submitter picked him up in a jar to move him. He was young so he hadn’t learned which places were and weren’t safe yet! Our submitter placed him in a mason jar as to not stress the little guy out too much by handling him. She took a few pictures to admire later before releasing him to a quieter, safer part of the yard.
